            <em>Verse 1</em><br>
            This skyscraper's causing vertigo<br>
            The countdown begins in Tokyo<br>
            27 days alone means 20 million ways to cope<br>
            Without you
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Chorus</em><br>
            I'm in a reckless fever<br>
            Love-struck girl, I'd tease her<br>
            Thought I'd never be her<br>
            Quite the job you've done on me, sir<br>
            You've been hosting parties in my mind<br>
            I'm working overtime to have you in my world<br>
            Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Verse 2</em><br>
            Forced to get creative, wrote my feelings down<br>
            The independent lady in me's nowhere to be found<br>
            I can't wait another day to see you<br>
            How embarrassing to be this way
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Chorus</em><br>
            I'm in a reckless fever<br>
            Love-struck girl, I'd tease her<br>
            Thought I'd never be her<br>
            Quite the job you've done on me, sir<br>
            You've been hosting parties in my mind<br>
            I'm working overtime to have you in my world<br>
            Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Bridge</em><br>
           I wait by the phone like a high school movie<br>
           Dream at the shows, you'll come runnin' to me<br>
           Think I see you in the wings, God<br>
           I'm hallucinating  
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Chorus</em><br>
            I'm in a reckless fever<br>
            Love-struck girl, I'd tease her<br>
            Thought I'd never be her<br>
            Quite the job you've done on me, sir<br>
            You've been hosting parties in my mind<br>
            I'm working overtime to have you in my world<br>
            Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl
        </p>
